# mtg-volodex

The `volodex` is a CLI companion app to discover new creatures for your [Volo, Guide to Monsters](https://scryfall.com/card/afr/238/volo-guide-to-monsters) Commander deck.
The application displays only the creature types that are not currently in your decklist, if one is provided.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `volodex`, you will need:
- `python >= 3.x`


## Dependencies

The `volodex` uses the following python packages:
- [click](https://pypi.org/project/click/)
- [more-itertools](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/)
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
- [mtg-parser](https://pypi.org/project/mtg_parser/)
- [textual](https://pypi.org/project/textual/)
- [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)


You don't need to manually install them, this is done when executing `./install.sh`.

Cards database is fetched from the [mtgjson.com](https://mtgjson.com) api.


## Getting Started


### Install the app

Set the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```Shell
$ ./install.sh
```


### Setup the card database

Download the card database and filter it:

```Shell
$ ./volodex.sh download
$ ./volodex.sh update
```

See also [Caching](#caching).


### Launch the application

Launch the cli `volodex` application:

```Shell
$ ./volodex.sh run [DECKLIST_URL]
```

If the `volodex` is launched with a decklist, creature types will be filtered to only show the ones that are not already included in the deck.

If the `volodex` is launched with no argument, all creatures elligible for a [Volo, Guide to Monsters](https://scryfall.com/card/afr/238/volo-guide-to-monsters) Commander deck will be listed.

The `volodex` relies on [mtg-parser](https://pypi.org/project/mtg_parser/) for parsing decklists and thus, supports the same deck building websites.


## Usage

ðŸš§ WIP


## Caching

The `volodex` creates two local cache files.
- `./AtomicCards.json.xz` is fetched from [mtgjson.com](https://mtgjson.com) when running the `./volodex.sh download` command. This file contains the list of all mtg cards.
- `./volodex.json` is created/updated when running the `./volodex.sh update` command. This file only contains the relevant cards for a [Volo, Guide to Monsters](https://scryfall.com/card/afr/238/volo-guide-to-monsters) Commander deck.
